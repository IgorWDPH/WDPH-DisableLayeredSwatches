# WDPH-DisableLayeredSwatches
For Magento 1.X. Tested on v1.9.3.9.
Disable color swatches for layered navigation only. Magento ColorSwatches upgrade.
Extension adds two new fields to the configurable swatches configs:
- "Enabled for Layered Navigation" which make possible to disable/enable swatches rendering in layered navigation;
- "Product Attributes to Show as Swatches in Layered Navigation" - multiselect identical to "Product Attributes to Show as Swatches in Product Detail" but works for layered navigation only.
